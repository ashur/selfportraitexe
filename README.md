## Notes

This is an old project and a poor example of constructing a bot using PHP:

- Several old, abandoned dependencies broken up in weird ways
- Odd organization owing to its original implementation as a standalone command-line application

You would do well not to use this project as any sort of guide, except maybe as an example of how _not_ to build a bot.
